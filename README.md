# SORA Accounting
## What is this?
This repo contains the recurring expenses for the SORA network, including the infrastructure development costs and other service costs necessary to keep the network running smoothly. 
## Why is this here?
The repo aims to provide transparency and control on the expenses incurred by the SORA network.
## Where can I find...?
- OnFinality/Subquery invoices are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14VQWNiE-MdCUDI_Nr0DE_GNhkArrpMzX-hvp-xAHzvo/edit?usp=sharing)
- Other invoices are available within folders in the repo
## How can I follow the progress?
Take a look at the [SORA Council Accounting project](https://github.com/orgs/sora-xor/projects/24), new invoices are added there and the Paid/unpaid status is tracked there as well
## I have a question/comment
Feel free to ask any questions regarding these invoices as comments within the specific repo, or ask in the [SORA Telegram channel](https://t.me/sora_xor).
